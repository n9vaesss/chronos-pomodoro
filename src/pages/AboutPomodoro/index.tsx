          <Heading>The Pomodoro Technique 🍅</Heading>

          <p>
            The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity method created by{' '}
            <strong>Francesco Cirillo</strong>, which consists of dividing work
            into time blocks (the famous "Pomodoros") interspersed with breaks.
            The goal is to maintain full focus for a short period while ensuring
            proper rest to avoid mental fatigue.

          <h2>How does the traditional Pomodoro work?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1. Choose a task</strong> you want to accomplish.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2. Work on it for 25 minutes</strong> without
              interruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3. Take a short 5-minute break</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4. After every 4 cycles, take a long break</strong>{' '}
              (usually 15 to 30 minutes).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>
            But <strong>Chronos Pomodoro</strong> has a twist 🚀
          </h2>

          <p>
            Our app follows the original concept, but with some improvements and
            customizations to make the process even more efficient:
          </p>

          <h3>⚙️ Time customization</h3>
          <p>
            You can configure focus time, short breaks, and long breaks however
            you like! Just go to the <a href='/settings'>settings page</a> and
            adjust the minutes as you prefer.
          </p>

          <h3>🔁 Sequential cycle organization</h3>
          <p>
            After each completed cycle, a new task is automatically added to
            your history, and the app suggests the next cycle (focus or break).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our default pattern:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Odd cycles</strong>: Work (focus).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Even cycles</strong>: Short break.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cycle 8</strong>: Special long break to reset the full
              cycle.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>🍅 Cycle visualization</h3>
          <p>
            Right below the timer, you'll see colored dots representing the
            cycles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>🟡 Yellow: Work (focus) cycle.</li>
            <li>🟢 Green: Short break.</li>
            <li>🔵 Blue: Long break (appears every 8 cycles).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This way, you always know where you are in the process and what
            comes next. No more writing things down or doing mental
            calculations!
          </p>

          <h3>📊 Automatic history</h3>
          <p>
            All your tasks and completed cycles are saved in the{' '}
            <a href='/history'>history</a>, with statuses like completed or
            interrupted. This allows you to track your progress over time.
          </p>
